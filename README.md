### Hello. ðŸ‘‹

I used to be an architect but now I'm a software developer. In the last years, I've founded, and closed, a startup working on SaaS for management and logistics, worked with both startups and agencies to get awesome products out.

I spend a lot of my time programming. Not just for work, but as a general hobby. I have a strong passion for learning new things, and Iâ€™m always taking time out of my day to pick up something new. I'm really passionate about good design and boosting efficiency through design and project planning. I try to use all my knowledge, mainly from my architectural background, in all I do.

I like to keep things uncomplicated.
